Script:

Hey, have you ever dreamed of an utopian world? Where you can play lottery an unlimited amount of time without ever losing money?
This world exists and it's yours.
PoolTogether allows you to realise this dream.
But then what is Pool Together ?
It is a Decentralized Finance platform working on the ethereum blockchain.
Why should you dive into the pool?
First, it means that no third party will take your money away.
It means that PoolTogether is trustless.
It’s also free to join for anyone on the earth without any requirement.
And it’s also secure thanks to the blockchain which makes code and funds auditable.
A deep dive in how it works:
People/Individuals like you and me can deposit fund in PoolTogether.
Dai and USDC are accepted. There are stablecoins pegged to the American dollar, and so are pretty good way to counter other cryptocurrencies' volatility.
The platform uses a lending protocol called Compound to make the pool generate/make interests on its funds.
At the end of every week, the interests are distributed to one lucky member of the pool and every other members recover their fund. 
You are the master of your fund, you can withdraw your savings and winnings at any time.
